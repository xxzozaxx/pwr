#+TITLE: PWR a minimal shell prompt written in Rust
#+AUTHOR: Ahmed Khaled

*pwr:* [p]ure [w]ritten in [R]ust. is shell prompt inspired by [[https://github.com/xcambar/purs][purs]] and git-status inspired by [[https://github.com/deathlyfrantic/git-status-prompt][Git Super Status II Turbo: Hyper Fighting]]
[[https://github.com/xxzozaxx/pwr/blob/master/screenshot/2018-09-05-212858_934x531_scrot.png?raw=true]]

* Installation
  1. fork this repo
  2. run ```cargo build --release```
  3. put the follow in your shell config file
     + mksh:
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       PS1=$'\n$(/PATH/TO/pwr)'
       #+END_SRC

     + Bash
       #+BEGIN_SRC bash
       export PS1='$(/home/master/Documents/Programming/Rust/Apps/pwr/target/debug/pwr)'
       #+END_SRC

     + zsh: IT SUCK. I searched and found nothing to do.

* Configuration

  you could change color, Symbols or pre-command symbol (λ in picture) be change the ~const~ in source code file.
  it locate in =pwr/src/main.rs= you will find the follow block

  #+BEGIN_SRC rust
  /* Config START here*/
  /* Colors */
  const AHEAD_COLOR:     ansi_term::Colour = Green;
  const BEHIND_COLOR:    ansi_term::Colour = Red;
  const BRANCH_COLOR:    ansi_term::Colour = Blue;
  const CHANGED_COLOR:   ansi_term::Colour = Purple;
  const CLEAN_COLOR:     ansi_term::Colour = Green;
  const DIR_COLOR:       ansi_term::Colour = Cyan;
  const STAGED_COLOR:    ansi_term::Colour = Yellow;
  const UNTRACKED_COLOR: ansi_term::Colour = Blue;
  /* Symbols */
  const AHEAD_SYMBOL     :&str = ">";
  const BEHIND_SYMBOL    :&str = "<";
  const CHANGED_SYMBOL   :&str = "+";
  const CLEAN_SYMBOL     :&str = "=";
  const PRECOMND         :&str = "λ";
  const STAGED_SYMBOL    :&str = "-";
  const STATUS_PREFIX    :&str = "(";
  const STATUS_SEPARATOR :&str = "|";
  const STATUS_SUFFIX    :&str = ")";
  const UNTRACKED_SYMBOL :&str = "_";
  /* Conifg END here*/
  #+END_SRC

** Note
   + please don't comment out or delete any line, instead just put blank string as ~""~
   + I declare only these colours ~Cyan, Blue, Red, Green, Purple, Yellow~, so if you want more please checkout [[https://docs.rs/ansi_term/0.11.0/ansi_term/enum.Colour.html][ansi_term colours]]
* Why

  1. To know more about *Rust*
  2. To know more about *Git*
  3. GOTO 1
  4. also, because [[https://github.com/xcambar/purs][purs]] didn't compile.

* Contribute

  feel free to pull requiest, any feature. also I hope if you know more about rust to review my code :).
  also this is the first rust code I ever write.
